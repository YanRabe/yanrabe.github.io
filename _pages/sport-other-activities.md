## Table Tennis 🏓
Before getting into Classe Préparatoire, I used to play table tennis for a decent amount of hours each week (between 2 to 4). I played for my local club called TTNM which is short for Tennis de Table Neuves-Maisons. Although my performances in competitive play were honestly rather horrendous, I enjoyed playing casually and the sport's technical aspect still amazes me to this day. That's why, with a friend of mine who also played table tennis, we decided to continue playing whilst in Classe Préparatoire, with a weekly meetup each Saturday at Lorraine-INP's private residence for an hour long fierce competition, which has begotten a never-ending rivalry between the two of us.

## Dancing 💃
As a heritage from my mother's own passion, I love expressing myself by dancing. I never had any actual lesson, but each time I had the occasion to join a dancing group or club of some sort, I took it. For instance, I was a highly invested pompom boy during both the CPPiades 2023 and the [CPPiades 2024](https://www.cppiades2024.fr/). As of now, I continue my journey as a pompom boy for ENSEEIHT's own pompom-club. Plus, I end my monday evenings by dancing Salsa with the school's Salsa club.

## 3D Modeling and 3D printing 🖼️
This new obession has now stuck with me since the end of high school, and has been directing most of my life choices since: From my internship to my desired specialisation in computer science, everything is influenced by my desire to contribute to the evolution of my passion. I am now quite decent at using the 3D modeling software Blender, as well as 3D printing little gizmos at home thanks to my personal 3D printer.
