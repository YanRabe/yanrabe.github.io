## Table Tennis üèì
Before getting into Classe Pr√©paratoire, I used to play table tennis for a decent amount of hours each week (between 2 to 4). I played for my local club called *TTNM* which stands for *Tennis de Table Neuves-Maisons*. Although my performances in competitive play were honestly rather horrendous, I enjoyed playing casually and the sport's technical aspect still amazes me to this day. That's why, with a friend of mine who also played table tennis we decided to continue playing while in Classe Pr√©paratoire, with a weekly meetup each Saturday at *Lorraine-INP* 's private residence for an hour long fierce competition, thus begetting a never-ending rivalry between the two of us.

## Dancing üíÉ
As a heritage from my mother's own passion, I love expressing myself by dancing. I never had any actual lesson, but each time I had the occasion to join a dancing group or club of some sort, I took it. For instance, I was a highly invested pompom boy during both the **CPPiades 2023** and the [CPPiades 2024](https://cppiades.tvn7.fr/) \(It's me on Nancy's miniature cover ‚ú®\). As of now, I continue my journey as a pompom boy for ENSEEIHT's own pompom-club. Plus, I end my monday evenings by dancing Salsa with the school's ***Salsa club***.

## 3D Modeling and 3D printing üñºÔ∏è
This new obession has now stuck with me since the end of high school, and has been directing most of my life choices since: From my internship to my desired specialisation in image rendering, everything is influenced by my desire to contribute to the evolution of my passion. I am now quite decent at using the 3D modeling software *Blender*, as well as 3D printing little gizmos at home thanks to my personal 3D printer.

## Music üé∏
As an avid music fan, I cannot stress how important it is for me to listen to some music before going to school or on the way back home. Furthermore I recently strengthened this passion for music by trying to learn how to play the guitar. I was - I acknowledge - a bit helped by my previous 8 years of piano...

## Photography üì∏
This is probably my most important hobby. I use photography as an expression of my inner feelings, as a way to capture and celebrate life around me, or just as a silly way of venting and having fun. Although it did not define the course of my education unlike 3D modeling, it plays a major role in defining who I am as an individual. I encourage you to check the [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/Cedrouuu_Yanouuu) I share with a close friend \(my photos are the ones with white borders\).
