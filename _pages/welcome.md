- Currently studying at [_ENSEEIHT_](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) engineering school, I am a student in computer science. I am passionate about 3D modelisation/3Dprinting and I am always looking for new challenges. 

- In 2024, I was shortly an intern at [MFX](https://mfx.loria.fr/) for 6 weeks, under [Sylvain Lefebvre](https://www.antexel.com/sylefeb-research/)'s supervision. My job there was to develop a small but complete Python App that would help the team generate harmonised 3d-printer profiles for their 3D [_Slicer_](https://icesl.loria.fr/). For that, I taught myself how to use the `Textual` module to create a pretty UI for the app, but I also had to actually understand how the machines work. Do not hesitate to check my internship report in the [publications page](/publications/), as well as the project's repository in the [projects](/projects/) and [repositories](/repositories/) sections.
This internship was necessary to validate my 2 years at La Pr√©pa des INP - Nancy, where I studied science courses in order to prepare my entry in an engineering school.

- Summer of 2025, I had a 8 weeks internship at [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) under [Meriem Ouederni's](https://cv.hal.science/meriem-ouederni) and [David Brunet's](https://microlearning.aniti.fr/author/david-brunet/119f2c9d8a6acb7c84a6cbabb3c84132b2002d65a21fef2f62f4fe4a12aeae48#app_top) supervision. We tried to quantify the usefulness of GenAIs academic-wise-- Specifically regarding Computer Science--, by establishing use cases and seeking its potential as well as it limits. Similarly to the previous internship, you can read more about it in the [publications page](/publications/), as well as the project's repository in the [projects](/projects/) and [repositories](/repositories/) sections.
This internship validated my 1st year of Engineering School at ENSEEIHT.
