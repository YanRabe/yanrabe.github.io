## CPPiades 2024 üèâ

> The [CPPiades 2024](https://www.cppiades2024.fr/) is a yearly event in June in which each _Pr√©pa des INP_ site from all over France gathers in one place to compete during 3 days in a dozen sports, along with nightly parties. This year, we did it in Nancy, which means our site had to organise the whole event.  

I was a key member of the organisation team, by managing both the **acommodation department** and the **IT department**. I mainly took contact and delt with most hosting sites in the city in order to find a place for each Classe Pr√©paratoire to sleep in. Moreover I made and regularly updated about half of the event's website with the help of another student. My participation also extended to the actual event, as I had to organise a decent amount of matches, help at cleaning, manage the whole acommodation system, manage the cloakroom during the parties, etc. while also taking most of the event's pictures.
This was an amazing experience in which I honed many social skills by actively communicating with the participants, but also because having great relationships with external service providers was mandatory to secure the event's well-being. As well, it eventually challenged my problem sovling skills due to the many unforseen accidents and delays we had faced.

## Photo7 üì∏

As of April 2025, I am now the vice-president of the school's photography association, and am responsible for the association's event planning: This means I am the one who asks for volunteers at the school's events or at outside gigs we are invited to, and planifies the staff organisation. Of course, as a membre of the bureau, this role implies many other smaller aspects.

Similarly, I am now the vice-president of our choir-club; Responsibilities are minimal here as I am mainly expected to help run our singing sessions and coordinating the club's overall organisation along with the other members of the bureau.

## Vegetarianism üçΩÔ∏èüå±

Due to my personal convictions regarding animal rights along with the known impact of the meat industry on our planet's climate, it has now been 5 years since I went almost fully vegetarian \(except for eggs and cheese\). This is a fundamentally personal journey I imposed solely on myself, with one of my goals being to better my food consumption's quality and lessen my individual impact on the environment.
